# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security.

# Overview of the Project

## Objective
- The backend for the project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments.
- The backend also supports various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb
- ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts

---

## Project Goals
1. **User Management** -- implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. **Property Management** -- Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. **Booking System** -- Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. **Payment Processing** -- Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. **Review System** -- Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. **Data Optimization** -- Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

---

## Technology Stack
**Django** -- A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
**Django REST Framework** -- Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
**PostgreSQL** -- A powerful relational database used for data storage.
**GraphQL** -- Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
**Celery** -- For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
**Redis** -- Used for caching and session management.
**Docker** -- Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
**CI/CD Pipelines** -- Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Team Roles
- **Product Manager**  
  Owns product vision, defines scope, prioritizes features, and aligns timelines with stakeholders.

- **Tech Lead / Architect**  
  Defines system architecture, patterns, and standards. Reviews critical design and code. Guides scalability and security decisions.

- **Backend Developer**  
  Implements API endpoints, business logic, integrations (payments, email), and unit/integration tests. Maintains code quality.

- **Database Administrator (DBA)**  
  Designs schema, manages indexing, migrations, backups/restore, performance tuning, and data retention strategies.

- **DevOps / Platform Engineer**  
  Owns CI/CD, infrastructure as code, observability, scaling, secrets, Docker images, and environments.

- **QA / Test Engineer**  
  Designs test plans, writes automated tests, validates releases, and enforces quality gates in CI.

- **Security Engineer (shared or part-time role)**  
  Threat models APIs, enforces authN/authZ, reviews dependencies, scans images, and handles incident response playbooks.

   - comment
   - created_at
   - **constraints** -- one review per `author_id` + `property_id` per completed stay

## Feature Breakdown
### 1. API Documentation
**OpenAPI Standard:** The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
**Django REST Framework:** Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
**GraphQL:** Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
### 2. User Authentication
**Endpoints:** /users/, /users/{user_id}/
**Features:** Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
### 3. Property Management
**Endpoints:** /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
**Features:** Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
### 4. Booking System
**Endpoints:** /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
**Features:** Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.
### 5. Payment Processing
**Endpoints:** /payments/
**Features:** Handle payment transactions related to bookings.
### 6. Review System
