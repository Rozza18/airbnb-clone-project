4. **Payment**
   - id (UUID)
   - booking_id (FK->Booking)
   - payer_id (FK->User)
   - provider {stripe, paybal, ..}
   - amount
   - currency
   - status {initiated, succeeded, failed, refunded}
   - provided_ref
   - created_at

5. **Review**
   - id (UUID)
   - reviewer_id (FK->User)
   - property_id (FK->Property)
   - rating (1-5)
   - comment
   - created_at
   - **constraints** -- one review per `author_id` + `property_id` per completed stay

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. API Documentation
**OpenAPI Standard:** The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
**Django REST Framework:** Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
**GraphQL:** Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.

### 2. User Authentication
**Endpoints:** /users/, /users/{user_id}/
**Features:** Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

### 3. Property Management
**Endpoints:** /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
**Features:** Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### 4. Booking System
**Endpoints:** /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
**Features:** Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

### 5. Payment Processing
**Endpoints:** /payments/
**Features:** Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

### 6. Review System
**Endpoints:** /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
**Features:** Post and manage reviews for properties.

### 7. Database Optimizations
**Indexing:** Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
**Caching:** Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## API Security
Security is **non-negotiable** in a platform handling sensitive user data, financial transactions, and high-traffic workloads.
1. **Authentication**
   - Mechanism: JWT (access + refresh) or OAuth2 with strong password hashing (Argon2/Bcrypt).
   - Purpose: Verify identity of users before granting access to resources.
   - Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized users from accessing accounts, protecting sensitive details like emails, bookings, and payment history.

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based (guest, host, admin) and object-level checks (e.g., only the host can edit their property).
   - Purpose: Control which actions a verified user can perform.
   - Why it matters: Protects business logic (e.g., preventing guests from editing other hosts’ properties).

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement per-IP and per-user rate limits using DRF throttling or Redis.
   - Purpose: Prevent brute-force login attacks and abusive scraping of listings.
   - Why it matters: Keeps the platform reliable, reduces denial-of-service risks.

4. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - Strict serializer validation, schema enforcement, and SQL injection protection.
   - Purpose: Ensure only clean, valid data enters the system.
   - Why it matters: Prevents XSS, SQL injection, and malformed payloads from corrupting data.

5. **Data Protection**
   - All traffic over HTTPS; sensitive fields (passwords, payment tokens) never logged.
   - At-rest encryption (PostgreSQL, cloud storage), secrets stored via env vars or secret manager.
   - Why it matters: Protects personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data.

6. **Audit Logging & Monitoring**
   - Log authentication attempts, booking changes, payment events.
   - Integrate with alerting/monitoring tools.
   - Why it matters: Helps detect suspicious behavior and provides an audit trail.

## CI/CD Pipeline
**What is CI/CD?**  
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It automates testing, building, and deploying code, ensuring that every change is safe, reliable, and fast to release.

### Benefits for this project
- **Consistency**: Code is tested automatically on every commit/PR, catching bugs early.  
- **Speed**: Developers can ship features faster without manual deployment overhead.  
- **Reliability**: Automated pipelines reduce human errors in deployment.  
- **Scalability**: Ensures new contributors follow the same build and release standards.  

### Tools we’ll use
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD workflows (lint, test, build, deploy).
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: Containerize services for consistent environments.
- **pytest + coverage**: Automated testing and reporting.
- **Black, isort, flake8, mypy**: Code quality checks.
- **Deployment Targets** (later): Cloud Run, AWS ECS, or Docker-based VM hosting.

**Typical pipeline flow:**
1. **CI (on PR/commit)**
   - Run linting/formatting checks.
   - Run unit & integration tests.
   - Build Docker image.
   - Generate artifacts (e.g., OpenAPI docs, coverage reports).

2. **CD (on merge to main)**
   - Push Docker image to container registry.
   - Deploy updated containers to staging/production.
   - Run smoke tests to verify deployment.
